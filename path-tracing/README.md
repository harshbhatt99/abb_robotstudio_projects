This project immitates the path tracing for the applications like sealing in the automotive industries. 

## Description

Due to lab setup, the path is traced on the whiteboard using the marker as an end-effector. The trajectory is prepared in AutoCAD and from the drawing total of 86 points are extracted to train the trajectory. The variable speed for straight line and the curvature is set.
